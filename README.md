# Hospital_management_system
Can we make a centralized real-time management system to have the update for each people how much bed is empty in a particular hospital and where we can get oxygen cylinder from a verified source ? Also hospital can update the stock of medicine to the manufacturer for more manufacture the product. Also this project can be open source project in github to develop such system as early as possible
